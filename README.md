Task_A
This Python script uses spaCy and dateparser to extract and categorize tasks from a text file. It identifies responsible entities, deadlines, and task categories using keyword matching and named entity recognition. The script reads sentences, processes dates, and categorizes tasks into predefined groups for organized task management effectively and efficiently.

Task_B
This Python script processes a movie reviews dataset. It cleans and preprocesses text, extracts features using TF-IDF, splits data, trains a Logistic Regression classifier, and evaluates performance. Manual validation with curated samples provides insights on balancing preprocessing, feature extraction, and hyperparameter tuning for enhanced sentiment classification accuracy, effectively boosting performance.
